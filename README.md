## 📰 News
- [ ] To Do: Release SHAREv2 (SHARE++)
- [x] (10/21) Release checkpoint links
- [x] (10/21) Initial code release
- [x] (10/15) We received the ICIP 2025 Best Student Paper Award!

## 🧩 Installation

To get started, create a conda virtual environment using Python 3.10+ and install the requirements:

```bash
conda create -n share python=3.10
conda activate share
pip install torch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 torchaudio==2.1.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📦 Datasets

SHARE is trained and evaluated on **DTU**, **BlendedMVS**, **RealEstate10K**, and **ACID** datasets.

- **DTU** and **BlendedMVS** datasets follow the preprocessing and download procedure of [VolRecon](https://github.com/IVRL/VolRecon).  
- **RealEstate10K** and **ACID** datasets follow the setup of [MVSplat](https://github.com/donydchen/mvsplat).

Please refer to the respective repositories for detailed dataset preparation instructions.

## 📥 Checkpoints

Pretrained SHARE model checkpoints are available for download link: [SHARE checkpoints (google drive)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TNtu5JWyua7m9uJLp8UR8k4A3WUDeCmH?usp=sharing)

The folder contains checkpoints for datasets trained on **DTU** and **RealEstate10K**, respectively.  

To use a checkpoint, download the relevant file and specify its path in your configuration or command line arguments as described in the training and evaluation scripts.

## 🚀 Running the Code

### Training and Evaluation

To run SHARE on each dataset, please refer to the command templates provided in the following files:

- `commands_dtu.md` – training and evaluation on **DTU / BlendedMVS**
- `commands_re10k.md` – training and evaluation on **RealEstate10K / ACID**
- `commands_cross_dataset.md` – for **cross-dataset evaluation**

All scripts are located in the project root and designed for easy reproducibility of the results reported in the paper.

## 📈 Cross-Dataset Evaluation

We provide ready-to-run scripts for evaluating cross-domain generalization using `commands_cross_dataset.md`.  
Please refer to the file for detailed instructions and dataset pair configurations.

## 🧪 Ablation Study
We provide ready-to-run scripts for ablation studies in `commands_ablation.md`.  
Please refer to the file for detailed instructions and experiment configurations.
